# WhatsApp-Analyzer

Last weekend, with quarantine in place on the 4th of July, I thought of picking up a new skill- #Regex. It is a powerful tool widely used in text mining. I am part of a WhatsApp group which was primarily created to communicate with each other about our cricket sessions we have in the evening. I used regex to extract information and create a data frame in Pandas and used it to put forward some simple EDA. 

WordCould: I created a wordcloud from the text messages sent by people over time. The most prominent words were ‘in’ and ‘out’ as expected because these are the two words everyone used to indicate their interest to play or not.

I also found that most people became active on the group between 3 and 7 which is just before our usual time of play which is about 7:30. 

Plotting the number of messages week-wise over month shoes that our group was most active during the 4th week which was around the end of May. This is because the group was formed in early May and kept on growing. However, some members relocated to other cities and hence again, their activity reduced.

Lastly, looking at the number of messages day-wise, we are most active from Monday-Thursday and not so active on the weekends! This was interesting as working professionals usually play during the weekends! But then again, this is what the data is telling, not me!
